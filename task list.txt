Eye Tracking

Whats's on market place right now with eye tracking
  - currently its used as a "focus tracker"
  - its used as a digital mouse on monitor/pc
What applications do we want to use with this?
  - using eye movement/focus to see where a user is looking
  - utilizing it along side the external cars/vehichle model


What approach do other models take?
  - They use the boarder/box method to first find the face
  - relative to the edges of the box an estimation is made on where they are looking
    - maybe add a gif here to show the situations
  - add acutual degrees to the estimation process
