Eye Tracking

What's on the marketplace right now with eye-tracking
  - currently, its used as a "focus tracker"
  - is used as a digital mouse on a monitor/pc
What applications do we want to use with this?
  - using eye movement/focus to see where a user is looking
  - utilizing it alongside the external cars/vehicle model


What approach do other models take?
  - They use the border/box method first to find the face
  - relative to the edges of the box an estimation is made of where they are looking
    - maybe add a GIF here to show the situations

  - add actual degrees to the estimation process

** Virtual Witness ** 
How will we frame this?
  - a need, product, and as a process (creating it) 
  - need: diagrams (readable but must have value), figures (convey an idea), case studies, and usage 
      - reference to the research papers and how others have done this and how we are different
  - product: 
  - processes: 

5-6 pages encapsulate all aspects of the virtual witness through need, product, and process.
