# EyeTracking
## Directive Study Research
- Purpose of this research study:
  - Create a model that is able to track specifically which region a driver is looking at to determine whether they have evaluated everything on the road in front of them as they drive.
  - This is meant to be used along side the External Distractions camera model being worked on by Ryan Jewett.
